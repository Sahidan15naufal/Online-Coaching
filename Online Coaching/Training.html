    <p><H3>1. Training Tips</H3></p>
    <span><p>A)Make your Own workout/traing split</p></span>
    <p>There are many training splitt in fitness world, but i'll recommend you this:</p>
    <p>-Day One Push (Push movement including Chest,Tricep and shoulder). Day Two Pull (Pull movement including Back, Bicep, Traps),
      Day Three Leg and calves
    </p> 
    <p>
     <span>B) Intensity and Volume</span>
    </p>
    <p>Both high-intensity training (HIT) and high-volume training (HVT) have their unique benefits, and the best choice depends on your specific fitness goals and personal preferences. <br>

      <span>High-Intensity Training (HIT)</span>
      Focus: Short, vigorous exercise sessions. <br>
      Benefits: Rapid strength improvements, effective fat loss, and time efficiency. <br>
      Mechanism: Drives muscles to temporary failure, promoting muscle growth and increased calorie burning. <br>
      <span>High-Volume Training (HVT)</span> <br>
      Focus: Multiple sets and repetitions at moderate intensity. <br>
      Benefits: Greater muscle mass increase and endurance. <br>
      Mechanism: Stimulates muscle growth through higher total workload. <br>
      <span>Scientific Insights</span> <br>
      Muscle Growth: Both HIT and HVT can lead to muscle hypertrophy, but the approach differs. HIT focuses on intensity and reaching muscle failure quickly, while HVT emphasizes the total volume of work done. <br>
      Strength vs. Endurance: HIT is more effective for rapid strength gains and fat loss, whereas HVT is better for building muscle endurance and overall muscle mass. <br>
      Conclusion <br>
      The choice between HIT and HVT should be based on your goals:
      <br>
      <span>For Strength and Fat Loss: HIT might be more suitable.</span> <br>
      <span>For Muscle Mass and Endurance: HVT could be the better option.</p></span> <br><br>
     <h3> 2. Nutrition </h3>
     <span><p>A) Protein Intake</p></span>
     <p>How much protein do I need? <br>
      <span>The current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 0.8 grams of proteinTrusted Source per kilogram of body weight.</span> How much protein you should eat per day varies from person to person. <br>
      “This means a person weighing 140 pounds only needs 51 grams of protein per day and another person weighing 200 pounds only needs 73 grams of protein per day, which is much less than “we are led to believe” by social media,” said Dana Ellis Hunnes, PhD, a senior dietitian with UCLA Medical Center.</p>
      <span><p>B) Supplement</p></span>
      <p>disclaimer this tips just for begginer.</p>
      <p>You have to priority real food with high protein, but if you need help to fill your protein intake you can buy protein powder.</p> <br><br>
      <h3>3. Sleep</h3>
      <span><p>A) Is sleep important?...</p></span>
      <P>The findings of a 2010 study by the American College of Physicians for example helps put this into perspective.
        Researchers split subjects into two groups: <br>
       <span>-one that slept 8.5 hours per night (which is within the range of what most experts recommend) <br></span>
        -another group that slept only 5.5 hours per night (which as noted earlier is pretty standard for many Americans nowadays).</P>
      <span><p>B) Benefit for muscle if sleep earlier... </p></span>
      <p>Here are some of the key ways that sleep helps with muscle recovery: <br>

        <span>1. Muscle repair and growth <br></span>
        <span>During sleep, the body releases human growth hormone (HGH), which plays a crucial role in muscle repair and growth.</span> HGH stimulates protein synthesis, the process by which damaged muscle fibers are repaired and new muscle tissue is built.
        <br>
        According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the more deep sleep you get, the more HGH is released. Conversely, when you skimp on sleep, there’s less growth hormone secretion. According to another study, a deficiency of HGH is linked to loss of muscle mass and reduced exercise capacity. It’s worth noting that both HGH and slow-wave sleep naturally decrease as we age.
        <br>
        <span>2. Muscle glycogen is replenished when you get your eight hours</span> <br>
        When we get quality sleep, our bodies also replenish muscle glycogen, a critical energy source that gets depleted when we work out.
        <br>
        <span>3. Sleep regulates protein synthesis</span> <br>
        Myofibrillar proteins are the building blocks of myofibrils—tube-shaped cells that chain together to form muscle fibers. So what does this have to do with sleep?
        <br>
        As with most things, sleep is the great regulator! New research has begun exploring the importance of sleep and how a lack of sleep may lead to loss of muscle mass and decreased muscle recovery.
        <br>
        <span>One study found that a group of men who were sleep deprived and then exercised had less myofibrillar protein synthesis, which would likely result in decreased muscle mass over time.</span> Another study found a broader relationship between sleep duration and muscle mass. That study compared two groups of people that either slept 5.5 or 8.5 hours while reducing their caloric intake. The shorter-sleep group lost more muscle mass than fat. Whether it is through myofibrillar protein synthesis or other pathways, it’s clear that sleep and muscle growth and recovery are closely linked.
        <br>
        <span>4. Glycogen replenishment </span><br>
        Sleep is also important for replenishing muscle glycogen stores. Glycogen is the stored form of glucose, which provides energy for muscle contractions during exercise. During sleep, the body restores glycogen levels, ensuring that muscles have enough fuel for optimal performance. <br>
        
        <span>5. Hormonal regulation</span> <br>
        Sleep helps regulate hormone levels that are important for muscle recovery. Testosterone, a hormone that promotes muscle growth and repair, is primarily released during sleep. Lack of sleep can disrupt testosterone production, which may negatively impact muscle recovery. <br>
        
        <span>6. Inflammation reduction</span> <br>
        Sleep plays a role in reducing inflammation in the body. Intense exercise can cause muscle damage and inflammation. During sleep, the body releases anti-inflammatory cytokines that help reduce inflammation and promote healing. <br>
        
        <span>7. Muscle relaxation </span><br>
        During sleep, the body enters a state of relaxation, and the muscles are able to rest and recover. This relaxation allows for the release of tension and promotes muscle recovery. <br>
        
        Does lack of sleep impact muscle recovery? <br>
        Lack of sleep can have a significant impact on muscle recovery. Here are some key findings from the search results: <br>
        <br>
        <span>Sleep is essential for muscle recovery.</span> When we sleep, our body undergoes several physiological changes that aid in the repair and recovery of damaged tissues. These changes are necessary for muscle recovery, especially after a workout or an injury. <br>
        Sleep deprivation can impair both muscular endurance and strength, with participants performing fewer repetitions and lifting less weight compared to when they were well-rested. <br>
        Sleep plays a critical role in the recovery of muscle injury induced by exercise. In a study conducted on mice, sleep deprivation reduced the recovery of muscle injury induced by high-intensity exercise. <br>
       <span> Sleep deprivation can delay muscle recovery, increase the risk of injury, and reduce muscle growth.</span> When we don’t get enough sleep, our bodies are not able to repair and regenerate as effectively. <br>
        Total sleep deprivation or restriction is known to alter not only blood hormones but also cytokines that might be related to skeletal muscle recovery. This study aimed to evaluate whether total sleep deprivation after eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage (EEIMD) modifies the profiles of blood hormones and cytokines. <br>
        <span>Not getting enough sleep will make your body more catabolic and will also delay muscle growth, especially if you're using a high-intensity training style such as lifting heavy weights.</p></span>
